    // The answer is derived from the observation that for each node u with K_u children,
    // the number of arrays where u's value is not equal to the XOR of its subtree (excluding u)
    // is (M+1)^(total nodes) minus the valid cases.
    // However, the problem is more complex because the conditions are interdependent.

    // The total sum of f(A) is equal to the sum over all nodes u of the number of arrays where u is bad.
    // But some arrays may have multiple bad nodes, but in the minimal operations, we only count necessary changes.

    // The key insight is that for each node u, it must be modified if and only if the XOR of its children's subtrees does not equal A_u, and this condition is independent of other nodes' conditions when processed in post-order.

    // For a node u, let x_u be the XOR of the entire subtree rooted at u. Then, the condition for u being good is x_u = 0 (when S_u is non-empty).

    // The total number of arrays where x_u != 0 is (M+1)^N - (M+1)^{N - K} * 1, where K is the number of nodes in the subtree of u.
    // However, this is not accurate. Instead, for each node u, the number of arrays where x_u != 0 is (M+1)^{N} / 2, because for any assignment to nodes outside u's subtree, exactly half of the assignments inside the subtree will make x_u zero.

    // However, this is only true if M+1 is even. Otherwise, the calculation is more involved.

    // The correct approach is to realize that for each node u, the probability that x_u = 0 is 1/(M+1) if the assignments are independent. But they are not, because the assignments in the subtree are constrained by the XOR conditions.

    // The solution involves for each node u, the number of arrays where x_u (the XOR of the entire subtree) is not zero, which is (M+1)^{N} - (M+1)^{N - 1} (for M+1 possible values, one of which makes x_u zero).

    // But this is incorrect because the assignments in the subtree are not independent. The correct value is (M+1)^{N} * (M / (M+1)) when considering that the XOR of the entire subtree is zero with probability 1/(M+1).

    // Therefore, for each node u, the number of arrays where x_u != 0 is (M+1)^{N} * M / (M+1).

    // But this is only true for leaves. For non-leaf nodes, the calculation is more involved because the XOR of the children's subtrees must be considered.

    // The correct approach is to compute for each node u, the number of arrays where x_u != 0 is (M+1)^{N} / 2, assuming that M+1 is even. But since M can be any value, we need a different approach.

    // The solution is to realize that for each node u, the number of arrays where u is bad is the total number of arrays where the XOR of the children's subtrees is not equal to A_u. This is (M+1)^{N} - (M+1)^{N - 1} = M * (M+1)^{N-1}.

    // But this is only true for nodes with non-empty S_u. For leaves, they are always good (S_u is empty), so they contribute zero.

    // So the total sum is sum_{u: S_u is non-empty} M * (M+1)^{N-1}.

    // The number of nodes u where S_u is non-empty is N - number of leaves. Because leaves have empty S_u.

    // But wait: S_u is the set of nodes v â‰  u in the subtree of u. So for any non-leaf node, S_u is non-empty.

    // So the number of nodes with non-empty S_u is N - number of leaves.

    // So the total sum is (number of nodes with non-empty S_u) * M * (M+1)^{N-1}.

    // So first, compute the number of such nodes.
